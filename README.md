# Find a book

## About this project

This is the fourth project I did for the [ADA ITW](https://adaitw.org/) Frontend Development course.

It is a website based on the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) that allows the user to find information about their favorite books.

## How to start

To access the project you must run the following command in your console:

`npm install`

## How it works

On the home page the user can find suggestions for books ordered by genre.

They can also do a search for a book or author, filtering by type (paid or free books) and sorting them from newest to oldest or by relevance.

Also, if the user clicks on a specific book, they can find:

- The name of the book
- The name of the author
- A summary of the book
- The average rating
- The genre
- A link to buy it on Google Play (only if it is for sale)

## Technologies
